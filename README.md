# Personality-Test
<p>This project uses C programming language to predict the personality characteristics of a person.
Personality tests are very useful because they show individual strengths that enable professionals to determine where their talents are best served. When individuals have a greater knowledge of their personality, they can discover careers and places that match their personality.</p>
<p>In the 1950s, John Holland theorized that personality and work environment are
measurable, and that the two should be matched in order to find a satisfying career.</p>
